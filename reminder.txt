1. Extend raw types with more general functions like toString and anything else that could be useful
2. Implement a common interface that forces all class to have some basic functions like toString (inspired by java)
    * Maybe also force them to name a class name in the constructor so that the class can be differenciated using a simple name
    * Would also allow me to make a generic toString that at least names the class name and InstanceCount
